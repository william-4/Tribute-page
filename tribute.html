                <p><strong>Famous Quotes</strong></p>
                <p>Where there has been racial hatred, it must be ended. Where there has been tribal animosity, it will be finished. Let us not dwell upon the bitterness of
                     the past. I would rather look to the future, to the good new Kenya, not to the bad old days. If we can create this sense of national direction and identity, 
                     we shall have gone a long way to solving our economic problems.</p>
                <p>You and I must work together to develop our country, to get education for our children, to have doctors, to build roads, to improve or provide all day-to-day 
                     essentials.</p>
                <p>God said this is our land, land in which we flourish as people... we want our cattle to get fat on our land so that our children grow up in prosperity;
                    and we do not want the fat removed to feed others.</p>

                <ul id="tribute-info">
                    <li>A member of the Kikuyu people, Kenyatta was born with the name Kamau in the village of Nginda.Birth records were not then kept among the Kikuyu, 
                        and Kenyatta's date of birth is not known.One biographer, Jules Archer, suggested he was likely born in 1890,[4] although a fuller analysis by 
                        Jeremy Murray-Brown suggested a birth circa 1897 or 1898.</li>
                    <li>In 1914, Kenyatta moved to Thika, where he worked for an engineering firm run by the Briton John Cook. In this position, he was tasked with fetching
                         the company wages from a bank in Nairobi, 25 miles (40 km) away.</li>
                    <li>In 1917, Kenyatta moved to Narok, where he was involved in transporting livestock to Nairobi,[31] before relocating to Nairobi to work in a store
                         selling farming and engineering equipment.[31] In the evenings, he took classes in a church mission school.[31] Several months later he returned 
                         to Thika before obtaining employment building houses for the Thogota Mission.</li>
                    <li>In April 1922, Kenyatta began working as a stores clerk and meter reader for Cook, who had been appointed water superintendent for Nairobi's 
                        municipal council.[41] He earned 250 shillings a month, a particularly high wage for a native African, which brought him financial independence 
                        and a growing sense of self-confidence.</li>
                    <li>Kenyatta's interest in politics stemmed from his friendship with James Beauttah, a senior figure in the Kikuyu Central Association (KCA). 
                        Beauttah took Kenyatta to a political meeting in Pumwani, although this led to no firm involvement at the time.[50] In either 1925 or early 1926, 
                        Beauttah moved to Uganda, but remained in contact with Kenyatta.[46] When the KCA wrote to Beauttah and asked him to travel to London as their 
                        representative, he declined, but recommended that Kenyatta—who had a good command of English—go in his place.[51] Kenyatta accepted, probably 
                        on the condition that the Association matched his pre-existing wage.[52] He thus became the group's secretary</li>
                    <li>After the KCA raised sufficient funds, in February 1929 Kenyatta sailed from Mombasa to Britain.[62] Grigg's administration could not stop 
                        Kenyatta's journey but asked London's Colonial Office not to meet with him.[63] He initially stayed at the West African Students' Union premises
                         in West London, where he met Ladipo Solanke.</li>
                    <li>n May 1931, Kenyatta and Parmenas Mockerie sailed for Britain, intent on representing the KCA at a Joint Committee of Parliament on the future of
                         East Africa.[88] Kenyatta would not return to Kenya for fifteen years.</li>
                    <li>Between 1935 and 1937, Kenyatta worked as a linguistic informant for the Phonetics Department at University College London (UCL); his Kikuyu voice 
                        recordings assisted Lilias Armstrong's production of The Phonetic and Tonal Structure of Kikuyu.[115] The book was published under Armstrong's name,
                         although Kenyatta claimed he should have been listed as co-author.[116] He enrolled at UCL as a student, studying an English course between January 
                         and July 1935 and then a phonetics course from October 1935 to June 1936.</li>
                    <li>After the United Kingdom entered World War II in September 1939, Kenyatta and Stock moved to the Sussex village of Storrington.[153] Kenyatta remained 
                        there for the duration of the war, renting a flat and a small plot of land to grow vegetables and raise chickens.[154] He settled into rural Sussex life,
                        [155] and became a regular at the village pub, where he gained the nickname "Jumbo".</li>
                    <li>In December 1964, Kenya was officially proclaimed a republic.[320] Kenyatta became its executive president,[321] combining the roles of head of state and 
                        head of government.[322] Over the course of 1965 and 1966, several constitutional amendments enhanced the president's power.</li>
